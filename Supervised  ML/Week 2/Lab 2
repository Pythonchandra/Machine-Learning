Optional Lab: Multiple Variable Linear Regression
1.1 Goals
Extend our regression model routines to support multiple features
Extend data structures to support multiple features
Rewrite prediction, cost and gradient routines to support multiple features
Utilize NumPy np.dot to vectorize their implementations for speed and simplicity

1.2 Tools
In this lab, we will make use of:

NumPy, a popular library for scientific computing
Matplotlib, a popular library for plotting data
import copy, math
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('./deeplearning.mplstyle')
np.set_printoptions(precision=2)  # reduced display precision on numpy arrays

1.3 Notation
Here is a summary of some of the notation you will encounter, updated for multiple features.

2 Problem Statement
You will use the motivating example of housing price prediction. The training dataset contains three examples with four features (size, bedrooms, floors and, age) shown in the table below. Note that, unlike the earlier labs, size is in sqft rather than 1000 sqft. This causes an issue, which you will solve in the next lab!

Size (sqft)	Number of Bedrooms	Number of floors	Age of Home	Price (1000s dollars)
2104	5	1	45	460
1416	3	2	40	232
852	2	1	35	178
You will build a linear regression model using these values so you can then predict the price for other houses. For example, a house with 1200 sqft, 3 bedrooms, 1 floor, 40 years old.

Please run the following code cell to create your X_train and y_train variables.

X_train = np.array([[2104, 5, 1, 45], [1416, 3, 2, 40], [852, 2, 1, 35]])
y_train = np.array([460, 232, 178])

2.1 Matrix X containing our examples
Similar to the table above, examples are stored in a NumPy matrix X_train. Each row of the matrix represents one example. When you have 𝑚
 training examples ( 𝑚
 is three in our example), and there are 𝑛
 features (four in our example), 𝐗
 is a matrix with dimensions (𝑚
, 𝑛
) (m rows, n columns).

𝐗=𝑥(0)0𝑥(1)0⋯𝑥(𝑚−1)0𝑥(0)1𝑥(1)1𝑥(𝑚−1)1⋯⋯⋯𝑥(0)𝑛−1𝑥(1)𝑛−1𝑥(𝑚−1)𝑛−1
notation:

𝐱(𝑖)
 is vector containing example i. 𝐱(𝑖)
 =(𝑥(𝑖)0,𝑥(𝑖)1,⋯,𝑥(𝑖)𝑛−1)
𝑥(𝑖)𝑗
 is element j in example i. The superscript in parenthesis indicates the example number while the subscript represents an element.
Display the input data.

# data is stored in numpy array/matrix
print(f"X Shape: {X_train.shape}, X Type:{type(X_train)})")
print(X_train)
print(f"y Shape: {y_train.shape}, y Type:{type(y_train)})")
print(y_train)
X Shape: (3, 4), X Type:<class 'numpy.ndarray'>)
[[2104    5    1   45]
 [1416    3    2   40]
 [ 852    2    1   35]]
y Shape: (3,), y Type:<class 'numpy.ndarray'>)
[460 232 178]

2.2 Parameter vector w, b
𝐰
 is a vector with 𝑛
 elements.
Each element contains the parameter associated with one feature.
in our dataset, n is 4.
notionally, we draw this as a column vector
𝐰=𝑤0𝑤1⋯𝑤𝑛−1
𝑏
 is a scalar parameter.
For demonstration, 𝐰
 and 𝑏
 will be loaded with some initial selected values that are near the optimal. 𝐰
 is a 1-D NumPy vector.

b_init = 785.1811367994083
w_init = np.array([ 0.39133535, 18.75376741, -53.36032453, -26.42131618])
print(f"w_init shape: {w_init.shape}, b_init type: {type(b_init)}")
w_init shape: (4,), b_init type: <class 'float'>

3 Model Prediction With Multiple Variables
The model's prediction with multiple variables is given by the linear model:

𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱)=𝑤0𝑥0+𝑤1𝑥1+...+𝑤𝑛−1𝑥𝑛−1+𝑏(1)
or in vector notation:
𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱)=𝐰⋅𝐱+𝑏(2)
where ⋅
 is a vector dot product

To demonstrate the dot product, we will implement prediction using (1) and (2).


3.1 Single Prediction element by element
Our previous prediction multiplied one feature value by one parameter and added a bias parameter. A direct extension of our previous implementation of prediction to multiple features would be to implement (1) above using loop over each element, performing the multiply with its parameter and then adding the bias parameter at the end.

def predict_single_loop(x, w, b): 
    """
    single predict using linear regression
    
    Args:
      x (ndarray): Shape (n,) example with multiple features
      w (ndarray): Shape (n,) model parameters    
      b (scalar):  model parameter     
      
    Returns:
      p (scalar):  prediction
    """
    n = x.shape[0]
    p = 0
    for i in range(n):
        p_i = x[i] * w[i]  
        p = p + p_i         
    p = p + b                
    return p
# get a row from our training data
x_vec = X_train[0,:]
print(f"x_vec shape {x_vec.shape}, x_vec value: {x_vec}")
​
# make a prediction
f_wb = predict_single_loop(x_vec, w_init, b_init)
print(f"f_wb shape {f_wb.shape}, prediction: {f_wb}")
x_vec shape (4,), x_vec value: [2104    5    1   45]
f_wb shape (), prediction: 459.9999976194083
Note the shape of x_vec. It is a 1-D NumPy vector with 4 elements, (4,). The result, f_wb is a scalar.


3.2 Single Prediction, vector
Noting that equation (1) above can be implemented using the dot product as in (2) above. We can make use of vector operations to speed up predictions.

Recall from the Python/Numpy lab that NumPy np.dot()[link] can be used to perform a vector dot product.

def predict(x, w, b): 
    """
    single predict using linear regression
    Args:
      x (ndarray): Shape (n,) example with multiple features
      w (ndarray): Shape (n,) model parameters   
      b (scalar):             model parameter 
      
    Returns:
      p (scalar):  prediction
    """
    p = np.dot(x, w) + b     
    return p    
# get a row from our training data
x_vec = X_train[0,:]
print(f"x_vec shape {x_vec.shape}, x_vec value: {x_vec}")
​
# make a prediction
f_wb = predict(x_vec,w_init, b_init)
print(f"f_wb shape {f_wb.shape}, prediction: {f_wb}")
x_vec shape (4,), x_vec value: [2104    5    1   45]
f_wb shape (), prediction: 459.99999761940825
The results and shapes are the same as the previous version which used looping. Going forward, np.dot will be used for these operations. The prediction is now a single statement. Most routines will implement it directly rather than calling a separate predict routine.


4 Compute Cost With Multiple Variables
The equation for the cost function with multiple variables 𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)
 is:
𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)=12𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))−𝑦(𝑖))2(3)
where:
𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))=𝐰⋅𝐱(𝑖)+𝑏(4)
In contrast to previous labs, 𝐰
 and 𝐱(𝑖)
 are vectors rather than scalars supporting multiple features.

Below is an implementation of equations (3) and (4). Note that this uses a standard pattern for this course where a for loop over all m examples is used.

def compute_cost(X, y, w, b): 
    """

      X (ndarray (m,n)): Data, m examples with n features
      y (ndarray (m,)) : target values

      b (scalar)       : model parameter
      
    Returns:
      cost (scalar): cost
    """
    m = X.shape[0]
    cost = 0.0

        f_wb_i = np.dot(X[i], w) + b           #(n,)(n,) = scalar (see np.dot)
        cost = cost + (f_wb_i - y[i])**2       #scalar
    cost = cost / (2 * m)                      #scalar    
    return cost
# Compute and display cost using our pre-chosen optimal parameters. 
cost = compute_cost(X_train, y_train, w_init, b_init)
print(f'Cost at optimal w : {cost}')
Expected Result: Cost at optimal w : 1.5578904045996674e-12


5 Gradient Descent With Multiple Variables
Gradient descent for multiple variables:

, are updated simultaneously and where

m is the number of training examples in the data set
𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))
 is the model's prediction, while 𝑦(𝑖)
 is the target value

5.1 Compute Gradient with Multiple Variables
An implementation for calculating the equations (6) and (7) is below. There are many ways to implement this. In this version, there is an

outer loop over all m examples.
∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑏
 for the example can be computed directly and accumulated
in a second loop over all n features:
∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑤𝑗
 is computed for each 𝑤𝑗
.
